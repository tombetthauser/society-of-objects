## Incoherent Project Overview...

> 
> TLDR: computer history analog sculpture fan art cast in concrete at 1:6 scale<br/>
<!-- > more images: [twitter.com/societyobjects](https://twitter.com/societyobjects) -->
> 

Art objects for the home or office. Original sculptures made in oil clay, molded in silicone and cast in resin and concrete mostly. Available upon request especially for tech workers / software engineers. Send images of them on your desk at work or out in the world! Initial group rendered at 1:6 scale. While working on them thought about them as scalable monuments to future success or failure. Desk meditation focal points for increased productivity during the work day. Machines dreaming about me dreaming about them while I work on a machine telling other machines what to do. Friendly educational objects for my son to form an early relationship with as he enters a world of machines and people. Computer friends helping us survive in a strange and challanging universe. The the historical vanguard of personal computers that first found their way into our everyday lives. Tricycles for the mind. Approachable objects to to facilitate interest in computer history. Loving tributes to pacific rim gotcha-pon and scale model culture. Anthropomorphised innanimate commodities. Archaic smiley faces. Simple fun objects watching me work and helping me enjoy my day.



<!-- ### Unordered General Notes:

* hand made art objects for the home or office
* scalable monuments to success and failure
* needlessly accurate historical reproductions
* 6:1 scale mock-ups for 1:6 inverse scale
* commodifying machines dominating contemporary existence
* pacific rim gotcha-pon collectible culture
* archaic smile indicating life in death or death in life
* projecting emotions on inanimate objects
* exploring objects

## If You Want a Computer...

### Get a Computer:
1) you may have recieved a computer by mail or found computer in woods desert storm drain etc
3) if you dont have one dm request to [@societyobjects](https://twitter.com/societyobjects)!
4) pay what you want if desired for materials labor student loans etc
5) studio art / passion project not profit-oriented

### Share a Photo:
1) ideally place computer on desk at work with actual work computer office supplies etc
2) alternatively place in domestic or outdoor space lawn kitchen sink sidewalk homedepot ikea mcdonalds abandoned structure
3) share photos by dm [@societyobjects](https://twitter.com/societyobjects) or maybe [#societyofobjects](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23societyofobjects&src=typed_query) etc
4) would love to see where these end up in peoples lives / the world

## Pipe-Dream Future Plans...

### Leaving them on Earth...
* leave sculptures in public / outdoor locations
* no context no needless information
* possibly a qr code to this url
* leave-behind sculpture or gray-area graffiti
* known problem of pieces getting separated

### Making them life-sized:
* considering possibility of moving up to 1:1 scale
* have had mixed responses on that possibility
* might change the feel / relationship they invite
* might also 
* also possibly moving up to 1:6 scale 

### Making them six feet tall...
* could flip scale from 1:6 to 6:1 (reverse Barbie scale)
* would make computers roughly 4-7 feet tall
* would need sectioned bolt-together mold
* rough sketches made it look surprisingly feasible
* definitely time consuming though
* would need to make temp wooden mock-up of computer
* could have some clay or plaster sections for keyboard / face etc
* either all together or section by section
* then coat with molding material
* could do a slilcone skin backed by boltable plywood
* or could do semitransluscent boltable fiberglass
* then could pour concrete into bolted mold then unbolt
* would be fairly expensive / impractical / awesome
* or could present just as bolted fiberglass
* could project images inside
* reasonable to transport
* burning man **(echo)**

## Scattered Production Notes...

### Sculpting during bootcamp:
* started project shortly before onset of COVID pandemic
* working in non-drying oil clay
* made while attending a coding bootcamp to pursue software engineering job
* prior to this taught mainly drawing / painting
* made web art / artists websites as side projects
* worked slowly during bootcamp

### Finishing sculptures:
* began working more on sculptures after securing first software job
* started learning more about computer history
* started making sculptures more accurate
* decided to choose scale to save deciscion-making time
* explored popular scales from model-making culture
* 1:6 scale closest to size already working in
* also Barbie / GI Joe scale as bonus
* worked on computers after work / putting 1 year old to bed
* took much longer than expected
* self-destructive detail obcession

### Mold-making process:
* after completing initial 3 computers began molding process
* not trained as a sculptor
* learned immensly from model-making communities youtube etc
* wife also artist taught me silicone mold-making
* eventually found right silicone and made molds
* made molds without vaccuum chamber
* molds turned out shockingly well
* used OOMOO 25 from Smooth-On (company)
* no bubbles / imperfections
* cast master set in resin first
* used Smooth Cast 300 also from Smooth-On
* cured in 15 minutes
* flawless no-bubble casts with no pressure pot
* got choked-up pulling the first cast out

### Concrete casting:
* no training or real experience with concrete
* had very difficult time finding resources online
* used Quick-Crete for casting from Home Depot
* added sand of varying grain size
* used different balances of flow-release and retarder
* also used dry pigments to darken and try adding color
* took meticulous proportion notes with each experiment
* balance between concrete / sand / water / pigment / flow-release / retarder
* wrote mini proportioning script in python to determine volumes
* process was time consuming but worked
* eventually found right balance for capturing details etc

### Finishing touches:
* got about 20-30 casts made in first run
* various colors, material proportions etc
* after this initial molds started to tear / deteriorate
* also had to figure out right sealant for concrete
* ended up using untinted shellac for initial coat
* liked organic feel but very shiny
* was advised to take shine off with steel wool
* ended up using matte water-based urethane as temp fix
* worked great and saturated color nicely
* fully retained look of concrete
* put foam pads on bottoms for desk use
* found appropriate shipping boxes and packing materials

## Known Project Issues...

### Leaving them in the desert:
* keyboard / monitor etc being separate presents possible issues
* might not make sense to leave them in public / outdoor space
* some pieces would not work as stand-alone works
* solution get resin cast sets and fuse together
* tamiya modelling glue and putty should work
* then make new molds from these
* might have to make small base / plinth underneath to combine pieces
* could be concrete part of mold or adhered wood
* adhered wood would allow pieces to remain separate
* no new molds would be needed ðŸ¤”
* liquid nails or a concrete adhesive would probably be fine
* making molds with a plinth section wouldn't make plinth mandatory
* could pour just to the computer bottom
* seem like good options, the plinth would look good
* concrete plinths could also be cast separately and adhered later

### No face versions:
* would like to make alternate monitor versions without faces
* process would require casting in a workable material
* wax seems possible, or resin and tamiya or 2-part putty etc
* seems like it would look good in large series
* possibly 2/3 no faces and 1/3 faces mixed in
