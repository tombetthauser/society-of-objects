  <h3>don't pay anything</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>you may have recieved a computer by mail or found computer in woods desert storm drain etc</li>
    <li>if you don't have one dm request to <a target="new" href="https://twitter.com/societyobj">@societyobjects</a></li>
    <li>three current computers are Robert, Don and Steve (in image above from left to right)</li>
    <li>pay what you want if desired for casting materials labor student loans etc</li>
    <li>sculpting is cheap but casting materials / shipping expensive-ish</li>
    <li>studio art / passion project not profit-oriented</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>share a photo</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>ideally place computer on desk at work with actual work computer office supplies etc</li>

    <li>share photos by dm <a target="new" href="https://twitter.com/societyobjects">@societyobjects</a> or maybe <a target="new" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23societyofobjects&src=typed_quer">#societyofobject</a> etc
    <li>would love to see where these end up in peoples lives / the world!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Future Plans:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>free 3d printable files</li>
    <li>leaving them in the desert woods urban space</li>
    <li>making them life-sized</li>
    <li>making them six feet tall</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Production Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>started sculpting during coding bootcamp</li>
    <li>finishing sculptures during first tech job</li>
    <li>learned silicone mold-making process</li>
    <li>made resin master-copies</li>
    <li>learned concrete casting process</li>
    <li>learned to shellac seal concrete</li>
    <li>made online </li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Sculpting during bootcamp:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>started project shortly before onset of COVID pandemic</li>
    <li>working in non-drying oil clay</li>
    <li>made while attending a coding bootcamp to pursue software engineering job</li>
    <li>prior to this taught mainly drawing / painting</li>
    <li>made web art / artists websites as side projects</li>
    <li>worked slowly during bootcamp</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Finishing sculptures:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>began working more on sculptures after securing first software job</li>
    <li>started learning more about computer history</li>
    <li>started making sculptures more accurate</li>
    <li>decided to choose scale to save deciscion-making time</li>
    <li>explored popular scales from model-making culture</li>
    <li>1:6 scale closest to size already working in</li>
    <li>also Barbie / GI Joe scale as bonus</li>
    <li>worked on computers after work / putting 1 year old to bed</li>
    <li>took much longer than expected</li>
    <li>self-destructive detail obcession</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mold-making process:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>after completing initial 3 computers began molding process</li>
    <li>not trained as a sculptor</li>
    <li>learned immensly from model-making communities youtube etc</li>
    <li>wife also artist taught me silicone mold-making</li>
    <li>eventually found right silicone and made molds</li>
    <li>made molds without vaccuum chamber</li>
    <li>molds turned out shockingly well</li>
    <li>used OOMOO 25 from Smooth-On (company)</li>
    <li>no bubbles / imperfections</li>
    <li>cast master set in resin first</li>
    <li>used Smooth Cast 300 also from Smooth-On</li>
    <li>cured in 15 minutes</li>
    <li>flawless no-bubble casts with no pressure pot</li>
    <li>got choked-up pulling the first cast out</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Concrete casting:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>no training or real experience with concrete</li>
    <li>had very difficult time finding resources online</li>
    <li>used Quick-Crete for casting from Home Depot</li>
    <li>added sand of varying grain size</li>
    <li>used different balances of flow-release and retarder</li>
    <li>also used dry pigments to darken and try adding color</li>
    <li>took meticulous proportion notes with each experiment</li>
    <li>balance between concrete / sand / water / pigment / flow-release / retarder</li>
    <li>wrote mini proportioning script in python to determine volumes</li>
    <li>process was time consuming but worked</li>
    <li>eventually found right balance for capturing details etc</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Finishing touches:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>got about 20-30 casts made in first run</li>
    <li>various colors, material proportions etc</li>
    <li>after this initial molds started to tear / deteriorate</li>
    <li>also had to figure out right sealant for concrete</li>
    <li>ended up using untinted shellac for initial coat</li>
    <li>liked organic feel but very shiny</li>
    <li>was advised to take shine off with steel wool</li>
    <li>ended up using matte water-based urethane as temp fix</li>
    <li>worked great and saturated color nicely</li>
    <li>fully retained look of concrete</li>
    <li>put foam pads on bottoms for desk use</li>
    <li>found appropriate shipping boxes and packing materials</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Known Project Issues...</h2>

  <h3>Single piece versions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>keyboard / monitor etc being separate presents possible issues</li>
    <li>might not make sense to leave them in public / outdoor space</li>
    <li>some pieces would not work as stand-alone works</li>
    <li>solution get resin cast sets and fuse together</li>
    <li>tamiya modelling glue and putty should work</li>
    <li>then make new molds from these</li>
    <li>might have to make small base / plinth underneath to combine pieces</li>
    <li>could be concrete part of mold or adhered wood</li>
    <li>adhered wood would allow pieces to remain separate</li>
    <li>no new molds would be needed ðŸ¤”</li>
    <li>liquid nails or a concrete adhesive would probably be fine</li>
    <li>making molds with a plinth section wouldn't make plinth mandatory</li>
    <li>could pour just to the computer bottom</li>
    <li>seem like good options, the plinth would look good</li>
    <li>concrete plinths could also be cast separately and adhered later</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reworking in wax:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>would like to make alternate monitor versions without faces</li>
    <li>process would require casting in a workable material</li>
    <li>wax seems possible, or resin and tamiya or 2-part putty etc</li>
    <li>seems like it would look good in large series</li>
    <li>possibly 2/3 no faces and 1/3 faces mixed in</li>
  </ul>
