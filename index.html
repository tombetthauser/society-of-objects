    <!-- <p>
      started sculpting during coding bootcamp<br>
      inspired by history of computing / software<br>
      finished initial set during first dev job<br>
      learned silicone mold-making process<br>
      made resin master-copies<br>
      learned concrete casting process<br>
      learned concrete sealing process<br>
      made readme and soc-media pages<br>

    <p>
      started sculpting during coding bootcamp<br>
      working in non-drying oil clay<br>
      made while attending a coding bootcamp to pursue software engineering job<br>
      inspired by history of computing / software<br>
      finished initial set during first dev job<br>
      started making sculptures more accurate<br>
      decided to choose scale to save decision-making<br>
      1:6 scale closest to size already working in<br>
      barbie / gi joe scale as bonus<br>
      took much longer than expected<br>
      completed initial 3 computers began molding process<br>
      not trained sculptor<br>
      learned from model-making communities youtube etc<br>
      wife also artist taught silicone mold-making<br>
      eventually found right silicone and made molds<br>
      made molds without vacuum chamber<br>
      molds turned out better than expected<br>
      used OOMOO 25 from Smooth-On (company)<br>
      no bubbles / imperfections<br>
      cast master set in resin<br>
      used Smooth Cast 300 also from Smooth-On<br>
      flawless no-bubble casts no pressure pot<br>
      no training or experience with concrete<br>
      had difficult time finding resources<br>
      used Quick-Crete for casting Home Depot<br>
      sand aggregate of varying grain size<br>
      different balances of flow-release and retarder<br>
      used dry pigments to darken and color<br>
      meticulous proportion notes with each cast<br>
      got about 20-30 casts made in first run<br>
      various colors, material proportions etc<br>
      after this initial molds deteriorated<br>
      experimented for right sealant for concrete<br>
      ended up using shellac for initial coat very shiny<br>
      matte water-based urethane as temp fix<br>>
      put foam pads on bottoms for desk use<br>
      found appropriate shipping boxes and packing materials<br>
      made readme and soc-media pages<br>
      began mailing to other devs artists friends<br>
